#About Regex 
##A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp; sometimes referred to as rational expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. 
Regular expression techniques are developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.

#Summary
###Regular expressions are used in search engines, in search and replace dialogs of word processors and text editors, in text processing utilities such as sed and AWK, and in lexical analysis. Most general-purpose programming languages 
support regex capabilities either natively or via libraries, including Python, C, C++, Java,Rust, OCaml, and JavaScript.
